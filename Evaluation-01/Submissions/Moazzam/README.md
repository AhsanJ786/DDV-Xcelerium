# Restoring Division Algorithm Project

## Project Structure
- `Sample_files/division.c`: Implement the restoring division algorithm and basic tests
- `Sample_files/Makefile`: Create build automation
- `Sample_files/test.tcl`: Develop TCL script for advanced testing
- `Sample_files/run_tests.sh`: Write shell script for full test automation

## TODO List
1. Implement the restoring_division function in division.c
2. Create some basic test cases in the main function of division.c
3. Write a Makefile for building and testing
4. Develop a TCL script for advanced testing
5. Create a shell script to automate the entire testing process
6. Use Git for version control throughout development

## Git Usage
- Copy the Sample_files into your respective Submission Folders
- Make meaningful commits as you develop
- Create the Pull Request

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of the restoring division algorithm
- Comprehensive test cases
- Proper use of TCL for extended testing
- Functional Makefile
- Appropriate use of Git
- Code readability and documentation

Good luck!
